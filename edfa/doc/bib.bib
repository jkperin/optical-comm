Numerical methods are used to analyze the effects of optical modes and erbium confinement on amplifier performance, and to calculate both the gain and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra. Fibers with confined erbium doping are completely characterized from easily measured parameters: the ratio of the linear ion density to fluorescence lifetime, and the absorption of gain spectra. Analytical techniques then allow accurate evaluation of gain, saturation, and noise in low-gain amplifiers (G≲20 dB)},

	abstract = {Balanced phase-locked loops for optical homodyne receivers are investigated. When a balanced loop is employed in a communications system, a part of the transmitter power must be used for unmodulated residual carrier transmission. This leads to a power penalty. In addition, the performance of the balanced loops is affected by the laser phase noise, by the shot noise, and by the crosstalk between the data-detection- and phase-lock-branches of the receiver. The impact of these interferences is minimized if the loop bandwidthBis optimized. The value of Boptand the corresponding optimum loop performance are evaluated in this paper. Further, the maximum permissible laser linewidthdeltanuis evaluated and found to be5.9 times 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}times Rb, where Rb(bit/s) is the system bit rate. This number corresponds toBER = 10{\^{}}{\{}-10{\}}and power penalty of 1 dB (0.5 dB due to residual carrier transmission, and 0.5 dB due to imperfect carrier phase recovery). For comparison, decision-driven phase-locked loops require onlydeltanu = 3.1 times 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}. R{\_}{\{}b{\}}. Thus, balanced loops impose more stringent requirements on the laser linewidth than decision-driven loops, but have the advantage of simpler implementation. An important additional advantage of balanced loops is their capability to suppress the excess intensity noise of semiconductor lasers.},

This InP-based PIC contains two sampled-grating distributed reflector (SG-DBR) lasers, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), phase modulators, balanced photodetectors, and multimode interference (MMI)-couplers and splitters. The SG-DBR lasers have more than 5 THz of frequency tuning range and can generate a coherent beat for a wide spectrum of frequencies. In addition, the SG-DBR lasers have large tuning sensitivities and do not exhibit any phase inversion over the frequency modulation bandwidths making them ideal for use as current controlled oscillators in feedback loops. These SG-DBR lasers have wide linewidths and require high feedback loop bandwidths in order to be used in OPLLs. This is made possible using photonic integration which provides low cost, easy to package compact loops with low feedback latencies. In this paper, we present two experiments to demonstrate proof-of-concept operation of the OPLL-PIC: homodyne locking and offset locking of the SG-DBR lasers.},

In particular, we investigate the impact of forward error correction (FEC) on the end-to-end energy consumption. We compare the energy efficiency of commonly used modula- tion formats in 100-Gbps transmission, namely dual polarization- quadrature phase-shift-keying (DP-QPSK) and dual polarization- 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-16-QAM), for different transmission distance and input bit error rate. Our energy model includes consumption of transmitter, booster, link amplifier as well as receiver. Compared with previous digital signal processing mod- els, we provide a very detailed model that not only includes all the significant functional blocks (such as timing and carrier recov- ery, chromatic and polarization mode dispersion compensation, and FEC), but also takes into account impact of the number of samples processed every clock cycle and of operations other than multiplications. We have found that receiver energy consumption dominates in transmission systems that use electronic dispersion compensation over long transmission distances. Our results show that for short transmission distances where hard-decision decod- ing is adequate for both modulation formats, DP-16-QAM is more energy efficient than DP-QPSK. However, as the transmission dis- tance increases, the energy saving due to the low symbol rate of DP-16-QAM is offset by the energy consumption of soft-decision decoding. In this case, the two modulation formats have approxi- mately similar energy consumption.},

Numerical results for both binary and quaternary systems are presented so that these results combined with the characteristics of the phase recovery circuit will enable the "best" practical design of a {\{}PSK{\}} receiver. lt is assumed that the phase noise associated with the recovered carrier can have a nonzero mean and a Gaussian or a truncated Gaussian-type distribution. The static error of the phase noise is mostly due to offset frequency tracking of the phaselocked loop used to recover the carrier, but may also include an equivalent phase error produced by the comparator dead zone. The random component of the phase noise is due to thermal noise present in the recovery circuit and is also due to the random modulation that may be present on the carrier. Two plausible probability density functions are assumed for the random component of the phase noise to study the sensitivity of the detection results to the detailed characteristics of the phase noise. For small values of static error and phase noise variance and for moderate values of signal-to-noise ratio, it is shown that the two models of the probability distribution give essentially the same results. Since the exact method of determining the performance is rather complex, we also present some simple upper bounds.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}/p{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}},
